# Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

Docker allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

# Advantages of Docker

### Portability:
Docker containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments. This portability allows developers to build, test, and deploy applications seamlessly on various platforms, from development to production.

### Isolation:


Containers provide a high degree of isolation, allowing applications to run independently of the host system and other containers. This isolation ensures that changes or updates to one container do not affect others, leading to more reliable and predictable behavior.

### Resource Efficiency:

Docker containers share the host system's kernel, making them lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines. Containers require fewer resources, resulting in faster startup times and improved efficiency in terms of system resources.
Consistency Across 

### Environments:

Docker's containerization ensures consistency between development, testing, and production environments. This reduces the "it works on my machine" problem and streamlines the deployment process, making it easier to manage applications across different stages.

### Rapid Deployment:

Docker containers can be started and stopped quickly, allowing for rapid deployment and scaling of applications. This agility is particularly beneficial for dynamic and rapidly changing workloads, where applications need to scale up or down based on demand.

### Version Control and Rollback:

Docker images can be versioned, providing a mechanism for tracking changes over time. This version control facilitates easy rollback to previous states if issues arise, enabling more robust release management.

### Ecosystem and Docker Hub:

Docker has a vast and active ecosystem, and Docker Hub serves as a centralized repository for sharing and distributing container images. Developers can leverage pre-built images, reducing the need to recreate the entire application stack from scratch.

### Microservices Architecture:

Docker containers are well-suited for microservices architecture, allowing developers to break down applications into smaller, modular components. Each component can be containerized and independently deployed, scaled, and updated.

### DevOps Integration:

Docker aligns well with DevOps practices, promoting collaboration between development and operations teams. Containers can be integrated into continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automating the application delivery process.

### Security:

Docker provides built-in security features, such as namespace isolation and resource constraints. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

### Resource Utilization:

Docker optimizes resource utilization by allowing multiple containers to run on a single host, each with its own set of resources. This efficient use of resources contributes to cost savings and better overall system performance.

Definition: A popular open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. It is widely used for server and desktop environments.


# Installation Step

## Add Docker's official GPG key:
```
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg; sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings; curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg; sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

### GPG Key:
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) key is used for secure communication and data integrity verification. Docker uses GPG keys to verify the authenticity of the Docker packages during installation.


## Add the repository to Apt sources:
```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update 
```

### Repository:
A central location or server that holds a collection of Docker images, allowing users to share and distribute containerized applications.

### APT (Advanced Package Tool):
A package management system used by Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. It is used to install, remove, and manage software packages.

 # Working Of Docker

* Docker is a platform for developers and system administrators to develop, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are isolated environments that contain everything an application needs to run, including code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.  
* Docker containers are lightweight and portable, which makes them ideal for running applications in the cloud. They can be easily scaled up or down, and they can be deployed to any environment that supports Docker.  
* Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client is a command-line tool that you use to interact with the Docker daemon. The Docker daemon is a service that runs on the host machine and manages the containers.  
* To use Docker, you first need to install the Docker client and daemon. Once you have installed Docker, you can start creating and running containers.  
* To create a container, you use the Docker build command. The Docker build command takes a Dockerfile as input. A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.  
* A Docker image is a template for creating containers. It contains all of the files and settings that are needed to run an application.  
* Once you have built a Docker image, you can use the Docker run command to create a container from the image. The Docker run command takes the name of the image as input and starts a new container from the image.  
* The Docker run command also takes a number of options that you can use to configure the container. For example, you can specify the ports that the container should expose, the volumes that the container should mount, and the environment variables that the container should set.  
* Once you have started a container, you can use the Docker exec command to run commands inside the container. The Docker exec command takes the name of the container as input and the command that you want to run as arguments.  
* You can also use the Docker logs command to view the logs from a container. The Docker logs command takes the name of the container as input and displays the logs from the container.  
* When you are finished with a container, you can use the Docker stop command to stop the container. The Docker stop command takes the name of the container as input and stops the container.  
* You can also use the Docker rm command to remove a container. The Docker rm command takes the name of the container as input and removes the container.  
* Docker is a powerful tool that can be used to develop, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable, which makes them ideal for running applications in the cloud.  
* Docker is a popular choice for running applications in production because it is easy to use and it provides a number of features that make it easy to manage containers.  
## Pull an Image
```
sudo docker pull (image_name)
```
### For Example 
```
docker pull ubuntu
```

## Output
> Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
Digest: sha256:6042500cf4b44023ea1894effe7890666b0c5c7871ed83a97c36c76ae560bb9b
Status: Image is up to date for ubuntu:latest
docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest
> 
### Docker Image:
Definition: A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

## Pulling an Image:
Definition: Downloading a Docker image from a registry or repository to the local machine.

* This involves downloading an existing Docker image from a registry to your local Docker Engine.  
* Think of it as downloading a pre-built software package that you can then use to run your application.  
* You use the docker pull command followed by the image name and, optionally, the registry location and tag.  
* For example, docker pull ubuntu:latest pulls the latest version of the "ubuntu" image from the default Docker Hub registry.

# Docker Registory

* A Docker registry is a repository that stores Docker images.  
* It acts like a central location where users can find and share images.  
* The most popular and default registry is Docker Hub, although several other public and private registries exist.  
* You specify the registry location when pulling or pushing images using the format username/imagename:tag, where:  
* username is your account name on the registry (optional for public registries like Docker Hub).  
* imagename is the name of the image.  
* tag is a version identifier for the image (optional, "latest" is the default).  


## To know the exists image

```
sudo docker image ls
```

## Output

REPOSITORY    |   TAG     | IMAGE ID      | CREATED       | SIZE
--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------
ubuntu        |   latest  | 174c8c134b2a  | 3 weeks ago   | 77.9MB
nginx         |   latest  | d453dd892d93  | 2 months ago  | 187MB
hello-world   |   latest  | d2c94e258dcb  | 8 months ago  | 13.3kB

### Container: 
A lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

## To RUN the container {For specific time period in detetch mode}

```
sudo docker container run -d (image_name) sleep (seconds)
```
> -d - This option tells Docker to run the container in detached mode. This means the container will run in the background and the terminal won't be attached to the container's processes. You won't see any output from the container in the terminal where you ran the command.

* This command creates and starts a detached container from the specified image and runs the sleep command for a certain duration in the background. It's important to replace (image_name) and (seconds) with the actual values you want to use.

## To know the exist running containers

```
sudo docker container ls
```
```
sudo docker ps
```

## Output

CONTAINER ID|IMAGE |COMMAND    |CREATED        |STATUS        |  PORTS  |NAMES
------------|------|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------|---------
2fab2ad8f10e|ubuntu|"/bin/bash"|29 seconds ago |Up 28 seconds |         |clever_chebyshev

## To RUN the container 
```
sudo docker container run (image_name)
```
* This command can run the container but also exit immediatly

## To know the all exist containers (Stopped/Exited Container)

```
sudo docker container ls -a
```
```
sudo docker ps -a
```
* These commands lists all containers, including both running and stopped ones, on your system. It uses sudo for potential privilege escalation, followed by docker container ls with the -a flag to specify displaying all containers.
  
## To RUN container in bash shell and go in interactive terminal
```
sudo docker container run -itd ubuntu /bin/bash
```
### Then :
```
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
```
> -i: This flag stands for "interactive" and instructs Docker to keep the standard input (STDIN) open for the executed process. This allows you to type commands and receive output in the terminal.
> -t: This flag stands for "pseudo-TTY" and allocates a pseudo-terminal (PTY) for the container. This provides a terminal-like environment inside the container, allowing you to use shell commands interactively.

* The command is used to run a detached (-d) Docker container based on the Ubuntu image with an interactive (-it) session, starting the /bin/bash shell as the main process. It is also used when we want to installs any particular software in our container.

## To go direct in interactive terminal shell use :
```
docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
``` 
* If you want to come out from terminal shell without stopping container use :
```
ctrl + p + q
```
* If you want to exit by stopping container use :
```
ctrl + d
```

## To Remove the stopped/exited container
```
sudo docker container rm (container name/id) 
```

## To Start container 
```
sudo docker container start (container_id)
```

## For Example 
```
sudo docker container start 2fab2ad8f10e
```
## Output
> 2fab2ad8f10e

CONTAINER ID|IMAGE |COMMAND    |CREATED     |STATUS           |PORTS |NAMES
------------|------|-----------|------------|-----------------|------|---------
2fab2ad8f10e|ubuntu|"/bin/bash"|18 hours ago|Up About a minute|      |clever_chebyshev

## To stop container
```
sudo docker container stop (container_id)
```
 
 ## For Example
 ```
 sudo docker container stop 2fab2ad8f10e
 ```
## Output

>2fab2ad8f10e

 CONTAINER ID|IMAGE |COMMAND    |CREATED     |STATUS                      |PORTS |NAMES

## To Remove all stopped containers

```
sudo docker container rm $(sudo docker container ls -aq)
```

## To Inspect Container

```
sudo docker container inspect (container_id)
```

 ### If we want to know the logs of container we have to run the few commands before :
 ```
 Sudo docker container run -d (container_name)
 ```
 then :
 ```
 sudo docker container inspect (container_id)
 ```
 * When we inspect the container we have to copy the container IP address and paste in the Browser

then:
 ```
sudo docker container logs (container_id)
```

## To know the ongoing proccess in container (running container)

```
sudo docker container top (container_id)
```

## To know the state of the containers running in background (memory usage, cpu, etc.)

```
sudo docker container stats
```

## Port Mapping of a Container
```
#ip_address of container
```
```
#docker 3600 ->xyz:80
```
```
#ip_address of machine:3600 -> ip_address of container:80
```
```
sudo docker container run -d -p 3600:80 --name test1_web (image_name)
```

### Port mapping 
Port mapping in Docker involves specifying how ports on the host system should be mapped to ports exposed by a container. This mapping allows external traffic to reach specific services running inside the container. Port mapping is particularly crucial when you have multiple containers running on a host, and you need to avoid port conflicts.

### To know ip address of your machine use :
```
hostname -I
```
### To know IP address of your container use :
```
sudo docker container inspect container_id 
```
## To get access of shell of the container if we want to install any particular software in the container

```
sudo docker container exec -it (container_id) /bin/bash
```
then :
```
sudo apt-get update
```
then :
```
sudo apt-get install software_name
```
then :
```
software_name --version
```
## To change name of any Container 
```
sudo docker container rename (container_id) (new_name)
```

## To restart Container
```
sudo docker container restart (container_id)
```

## To show the ongoing process in background at the terminal
```
sudo docker container attach (container_id)
```

## This will kill / Stop the container
```
sudo docker container kill (container_id)
```

## To wait for container to stop
```
sudo docker container wait (container_id) 
```

## To Pause or Unpause the container

```
sudo docker container pause/unpause (container_id)
```

## To delete all stopped/exited containers

```
sudo docker container prune
```

## Output
>WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.

## To show continously every changes we will make to container in every 2 second

```
sudo watch 'docker container diff (container_id)'
```

## To copy a file to container

```
sudo docker container cp (file_name)/(container_id):/(source_path)
```

## To export container as file
```
sudo docker container export (container_id) >(file_name).tar
```

## To import image from the container file

```
sudo docker image import (container_filename).tar (image_name)
```
## To directly export a container and import as an image

```
sudo docker container commit --author "Name" (container_id) (image_name)
```

## To pull specific version of an image

```
sudo docker pull (image_name):specific_version
```
## To tag the image if we delete the first image it will contain all the files which is already installed in it

```
sudo docker image tag (image_name) (user_name)/(image_new_name)
```

## Pushing an Image on Docker hub

* This involves taking an image you've built or modified and uploading it to a registry.  
* This allows you to share your custom images with others or store them for future use.  
* You use the docker push command followed by the image name and the desired registry location. For example, docker push myuser/my-app:latest pushes your image named "my-app" with the "latest" tag to the "myuser" repository in a specific registry.  
 ### Docker Hub:
 A cloud-based registry service provided by Docker for sharing container images. It allows developers to store and distribute Docker images publicly or privately.    
 ## To push our customise image on docker hub and anyone call the image

```
sudo docker push (dockerhub_username)/(image_name)
```

## To show the format changes images details

```
sudo docker image ls --format '{{.ID}} , {{.Repository}}'
```

* Any format you want to change Please write in .{{}} , .{{}} , in this format


## To show the history of images

```
sudo docker image history (image_name)
```

* If there is an other tag or specific version of the image we have to declare


## To inspact the image

```
sudo docker image inspect (image_name) |less
```


## To save our image as a tar file which help us to share that image

```
sudo docker image save (image_name) > (image_name).tar
```
## This will help in loading the image

```
sudo docker image load <(file_name)
```
## To build an image

```
sudo docker image build -t (image_name):1 .
```

* . is indicating that docker file is in current working directory


## To remove image
```
sudo docker image rm (Image_name)
```

# Docker Volume

A Docker feature that allows data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container. Volumes are used for storing and sharing data between containers.


* If you want to use docker volume to retreive you old container data then you use docker volume. The data store in             
"Volumes": {  
             "/var/lib/image_name": {}  
},  
  There are few steps how you can access your old container:

## Step 1 - 
## Run a Container
```
sudo docker container run -d --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true mysql
```
## Output 

>98eeb0b3707bed3dd7ee833576dfef248c7c9114bfc5b61ef2d18a13a2eb8c20

## Step 2 - 
## To know exists Docker Volume
```
sudo docker volume ls
```

## Step 3 -
## Inspect Docker volume

```
sudo docker volume inspect (volume_name)
```
## For Example
```
sudo docker volume inspect 4364fa6d1b0fee8b6f08a165b13104e54af9ac0664a9faa6427ec2296de2ba2a
```

## Output 
>[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-01-10T22:42:41+05:30",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {
            "com.docker.volume.anonymous": ""
        },
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/4364fa6d1b0fee8b6f08a165b13104e54af9ac0664a9faa6427ec2296de2ba2a/_data",
        "Name": "4364fa6d1b0fee8b6f08a165b13104e54af9ac0664a9faa6427ec2296de2ba2a",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]

## Step 4 -
## Go in in the volume directory by using :

```
cd /var/lab/docker/volumes/(volume_name)
```

then:

```
ls
```
then:
```
cd (the directory found)
```
then:

```
ls
```
* You will see the stored Data.

## For Example 

```
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/5e209b16f702f75e7a3244f4e825ada25ee241ce2765ed292a8c57f9b34dd294/_data
```
## Output
> root@rahul-ahlawat:/var/lib/docker/volumes/5e209b16f702f75e7a3244f4e825ada25ee241ce2765ed292a8c57f9b34dd294/_data#


```
ls
```
 auto.cnf      |ca.pem             |ib_buffer_pool|mysql             |public_key.pem  
 --------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------
 binlog.000001 |client-cert.pem    |ibdata1       |mysql.ibd         |server-cert.pem
 binlog.000002 |client-key.pem     |ibtmp1        |mysql.sock        |server-key.pem

 ca-key.pem    |'#ib_16384_1.dblwr'|'#innodb_temp'|private_key.pem   |undo_001

## Now We will save our data in database 

## Run Container in which our database is stored (Go in terminal shell)

```
sudo docker container exec -it (container_id) /bin/bash
```
```
database_software_name
```
```
show databases;
```
### Now Create Database

```
create database (database_detail);
```

## For Example
```
sudo docker container exec -it 98ee bash
```
```
mysql
```
## Output
>Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 9

```
show databases;
```
## Output

```
create database rahul;
```
## Output

```
create database ahlawat;
```
## Output
>Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

```
create database jaat;
```
## Output
> Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)


* Now Remove the particular container
* Run another container using the command:

```
sudo docker container run -itd -v 5e209b16f702f75e7a3244f4e825ada25ee241ce2765ed292a8c57f9b34dd294:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

## Output

then:
```
sudo docker container exec -it (container_id) /bin/bash
```

```
docker container exec -it 434 bash
```
then:

```
mysql
```
### In mysql
```
show databases;
```
## Output 
>+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+

7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

## Docker volume name

```
sudo docker container run -d --name xyz_com_database12 -v (volume_name):/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true mysql
```

### For Example
```
sudo docker container run -d --name xyz_com_database12 -v abc:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true mysql
```
## Output
>a46cadf0b0f844fbf5268a23d581b5540e1bf8560a57eff6f380c0a7dffb8463

```
docker volume ls
```
## Output

DRIVER  |VOLUME NAME
--------|-----------
local   |abc

## Create a Docker volume
```
sudo docker volume create (volume_name)
```
## To remove volume 

```
sudo docker rm (volume_name)
```
* One by one remove

```
sudo docker volume prune
```
* All unused volume will be removed

## Docker Volume Bind
A technique in Docker that allows a file or directory on the host machine to be mounted into a container. Changes made in either the container or on the host are reflected in both locations.
### Steps:

```
mkdir bind
```

```
cd bind
```

```
 touch index.html
```
```
docker container run -it -v /home/rahul/bind:/tmp/test ubuntu:latest bash
```

## Docker Network

Docker networking enables a user to link a Docker container to as many networks as he/she requires. Docker Networks are used to provide complete isolation for Docker containers. 
* Note: A user can add containers to more than one network.

## To know the already present network
```
docker network ls
```

## Output

NETWORK ID    |NAME     |DRIVER   |SCOPE
--------------|---------|---------|------
750b0c4f972a  |bridge   |bridge   |local
2a6e1526767d  |host     |host     |local
a9bd3a5dd0ba  |one      |null     |local

## To create new Docker Network

```
sudo docker network create -d bridge (network_name)
```

 ### To creates a network using the bridge network driver and running a container in the created network:



```
sudo docker container run -it --network (network_name)(image_name)
```

## Divers of Docker

* The following network drivers are available by default, and provide core networking functionality:


Driver     |Description
-----------|-----------------------
bridge     |The default network driver.
host  	   |Remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.
none  	   |Completely isolate a container from the host and other containers.
overlay    |Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together.
ipvlan     |IPvlan networks provide full control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
macvlan    |Assign a MAC address to a container.
