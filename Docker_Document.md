# Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

Docker allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

# Advantages of Docker

### Portability:
Docker containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments. This portability allows developers to build, test, and deploy applications seamlessly on various platforms, from development to production.

### Isolation:


Containers provide a high degree of isolation, allowing applications to run independently of the host system and other containers. This isolation ensures that changes or updates to one container do not affect others, leading to more reliable and predictable behavior.

### Resource Efficiency:

Docker containers share the host system's kernel, making them lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines. Containers require fewer resources, resulting in faster startup times and improved efficiency in terms of system resources.
Consistency Across 

### Environments:

Docker's containerization ensures consistency between development, testing, and production environments. This reduces the "it works on my machine" problem and streamlines the deployment process, making it easier to manage applications across different stages.

### Rapid Deployment:

Docker containers can be started and stopped quickly, allowing for rapid deployment and scaling of applications. This agility is particularly beneficial for dynamic and rapidly changing workloads, where applications need to scale up or down based on demand.

### Version Control and Rollback:

Docker images can be versioned, providing a mechanism for tracking changes over time. This version control facilitates easy rollback to previous states if issues arise, enabling more robust release management.

### Ecosystem and Docker Hub:

Docker has a vast and active ecosystem, and Docker Hub serves as a centralized repository for sharing and distributing container images. Developers can leverage pre-built images, reducing the need to recreate the entire application stack from scratch.

### Microservices Architecture:

Docker containers are well-suited for microservices architecture, allowing developers to break down applications into smaller, modular components. Each component can be containerized and independently deployed, scaled, and updated.

### DevOps Integration:

Docker aligns well with DevOps practices, promoting collaboration between development and operations teams. Containers can be integrated into continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automating the application delivery process.

### Security:

Docker provides built-in security features, such as namespace isolation and resource constraints. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

### Resource Utilization:

Docker optimizes resource utilization by allowing multiple containers to run on a single host, each with its own set of resources. This efficient use of resources contributes to cost savings and better overall system performance.

# Prerequisites

## OS Requirement
* Ubuntu Mantic 23.10
* Ubuntu Lunar 23.04
* Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS)
* Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)

## OS Details

PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"  
NAME="Ubuntu"  
VERSION_ID="22.04"  
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"  
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy  
ID=ubuntu  
ID_LIKE=debian  
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy

### Ubuntu:
Definition: A popular open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. It is widely used for server and desktop environments.


# Installation Step

## Add Docker's official GPG key:
```
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg; sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings; curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg; sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

### GPG Key:
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) key is used for secure communication and data integrity verification. Docker uses GPG keys to verify the authenticity of the Docker packages during installation.


## Add the repository to Apt sources:
```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update 
```

### Repository:
A central location or server that holds a collection of Docker images, allowing users to share and distribute containerized applications.

### APT (Advanced Package Tool):
A package management system used by Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. It is used to install, remove, and manage software packages.

## To Inspect Container

```
sudo docker container inspect (container_id)
```

 ### If we want to know the logs of container we have to run the few commands before :
 ```
 Sudo docker container run -d (container_name)
 ```
 then :
 ```
 sudo docker container inspect (container_id)
 ```
 * When we inspect the container we have to copy the container IP address and paste in the Browser

then:
 ```
sudo docker container logs (container_id)
```

## To know the ongoing proccess in container (running container)

```
sudo docker container top (container_id)
```

## To know the state of the containers running in background (memory usage, cpu, etc.)

```
sudo docker container stats
```

## Port Mapping of a Container
```
#ip_address of container
```
```
#docker 3600 ->xyz:80
```
```
#ip_address of machine:3600 -> ip_address of container:80
```
```
sudo docker container run -d -p 3600:80 --name test1_web (image_name)
```

### Port mapping 
Port mapping in Docker involves specifying how ports on the host system should be mapped to ports exposed by a container. This mapping allows external traffic to reach specific services running inside the container. Port mapping is particularly crucial when you have multiple containers running on a host, and you need to avoid port conflicts.

### To know ip address of your machine use :
```
hostname -I
```
### To know IP address of your container use :
```
sudo docker container inspect container_id 
```
## To get access of shell of the container if we want to install any particular software in the container

```
sudo docker container exec -it (container_id) /bin/bash
```
then :
```
sudo apt-get update
```
then :
```
sudo apt-get install software_name
```
then :
```
software_name --version
```
## To change name of any Container 
```
sudo docker container rename (container_id) (new_name)
```

## To restart Container
```
sudo docker container restart (container_id)
```

## To show the ongoing process in background at the terminal
```
sudo docker container attach (container_id)
```

## This will kill / Stop the container
```
sudo docker container kill (container_id)
```

## To wait for container to stop
```
sudo docker container wait (container_id) 
```

## To Pause or Unpause the container

```
sudo docker container pause/unpause (container_id)
```

## To delete all stopped/exited containers

```
sudo docker container prune
```

## Output
>WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.

# Docker Volume

A Docker feature that allows data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container. Volumes are used for storing and sharing data between containers.


* If you want to use docker volume to retreive you old container data then you use docker volume. The data store in             
"Volumes": {  
             "/var/lib/image_name": {}  
},  
  There are few steps how you can access your old container:

## Step 1 - 
## Run a Container
```
sudo docker container run -d --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true mysql
```
## Output 

>98eeb0b3707bed3dd7ee833576dfef248c7c9114bfc5b61ef2d18a13a2eb8c20

## Step 2 - 
## To know exists Docker Volume
```
sudo docker volume ls
```

## Step 3 -
## Inspect Docker volume

```
sudo docker volume inspect (volume_name)
```
## For Example
```
sudo docker volume inspect 4364fa6d1b0fee8b6f08a165b13104e54af9ac0664a9faa6427ec2296de2ba2a
```

## Output 
>[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-01-10T22:42:41+05:30",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {
            "com.docker.volume.anonymous": ""
        },
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/4364fa6d1b0fee8b6f08a165b13104e54af9ac0664a9faa6427ec2296de2ba2a/_data",
        "Name": "4364fa6d1b0fee8b6f08a165b13104e54af9ac0664a9faa6427ec2296de2ba2a",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]

## Step 4 -
## Go in in the volume directory by using :

```
cd /var/lab/docker/volumes/(volume_name)
```

then:

```
ls
```
then:
```
cd (the directory found)
```
then:

```
ls
```
* You will see the stored Data.

## For Example 

```
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/5e209b16f702f75e7a3244f4e825ada25ee241ce2765ed292a8c57f9b34dd294/_data
```
## Output
> root@rahul-ahlawat:/var/lib/docker/volumes/5e209b16f702f75e7a3244f4e825ada25ee241ce2765ed292a8c57f9b34dd294/_data#


```
ls
```
 auto.cnf      |ca.pem             |ib_buffer_pool|mysql             |public_key.pem  
 --------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------
 binlog.000001 |client-cert.pem    |ibdata1       |mysql.ibd         |server-cert.pem
 binlog.000002 |client-key.pem     |ibtmp1        |mysql.sock        |server-key.pem
 binlog.index  |'#ib_16384_0.dblwr'|'#innodb_redo'|performance_schema|sys
 ca-key.pem    |'#ib_16384_1.dblwr'|'#innodb_temp'|private_key.pem   |undo_001

## Now We will save our data in database 

## Run Container in which our database is stored (Go in terminal shell)

```
sudo docker container exec -it (container_id) /bin/bash
```
```
database_software_name
```
```
show databases;
```
### Now Create Database

```
create database (database_detail);
```

## For Example
```
sudo docker container exec -it 98ee bash
```
```
mysql
```
## Output
>Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 9

```
show databases;
```
## Output

```
create database rahul;
```
## Output

```
create database ahlawat;
```
## Output
>Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

```
create database jaat;
```
## Output
> Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)


* Now Remove the particular container
* Run another container using the command:

```
sudo docker container run -itd -v 5e209b16f702f75e7a3244f4e825ada25ee241ce2765ed292a8c57f9b34dd294:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

## Output
> 434e9ebc0c92349b37550130dc483926d9f9c07d6fdabcda8fc32356cc77f45e

then:
```
sudo docker container exec -it (container_id) /bin/bash
```

```
docker container exec -it 434 bash
```
then:

```
mysql
```
### In mysql
```
show databases;
```
## Output 
>+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| ahlawat            |

| performance_schema |
| rahul              |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

## Docker volume name

```
sudo docker container run -d --name xyz_com_database12 -v (volume_name):/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true mysql
```

### For Example
```
sudo docker container run -d --name xyz_com_database12 -v abc:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true mysql
```
## Output
>a46cadf0b0f844fbf5268a23d581b5540e1bf8560a57eff6f380c0a7dffb8463

```
docker volume ls
```
## Output

DRIVER  |VOLUME NAME
--------|-----------
local   |abc

## Create a Docker volume
```
sudo docker volume create (volume_name)
```
## To remove volume 

```
sudo docker rm (volume_name)
```
* One by one remove

```
sudo docker volume prune
```
* All unused volume will be removed

## Docker Volume Bind
A technique in Docker that allows a file or directory on the host machine to be mounted into a container. Changes made in either the container or on the host are reflected in both locations.
### Steps:

```
mkdir bind
```

```
cd bind
```

```
 touch index.html
```
```
docker container run -it -v /home/rahul/bind:/tmp/test ubuntu:latest bash
```

## Docker Network

Docker networking enables a user to link a Docker container to as many networks as he/she requires. Docker Networks are used to provide complete isolation for Docker containers. 
* Note: A user can add containers to more than one network.

## To know the already present network
```
docker network ls
```

## Output

NETWORK ID    |NAME     |DRIVER   |SCOPE
--------------|---------|---------|------
750b0c4f972a  |bridge   |bridge   |local
2a6e1526767d  |host     |host     |local
a9bd3a5dd0ba  |one      |null     |local

## To create new Docker Network

```
sudo docker network create -d bridge (network_name)
```

 ### To creates a network using the bridge network driver and running a container in the created network:



```
sudo docker container run -it --network (network_name)(image_name)
```

## Divers of Docker

* The following network drivers are available by default, and provide core networking functionality:


Driver     |Description
-----------|-----------------------
bridge     |The default network driver.
host  	   |Remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.
none  	   |Completely isolate a container from the host and other containers.
overlay    |Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together.
ipvlan     |IPvlan networks provide full control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
macvlan    |Assign a MAC address to a container.
